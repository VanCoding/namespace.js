Namespace.js
========================
This is a library allows you to create good structured javascript frameworks.

Features
------------------------
- Folder-based namespacing
- "use" functionality that behaves like "using" of C# or "import" of Java
- compiling multiple libraries to one file
- prefixes to mark a file or namespace as "client-only" (+) or "server-only" (-) 


Example libraries
------------------------
There will be some senseless exmaple libraries in the future. They will help you
understand how the system works.

Just check out the "examples" folder.
